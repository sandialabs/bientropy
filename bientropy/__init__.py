This Python package provides high-performance implementations of the functions
and examples presented in "BiEntropy - The Approximate Entropy of a Finite
Binary String" by Grenville J.  Croll, presented at ANPA 34 in 2013.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0954

According to the paper, BiEntropy is "a simple algorithm which computes the
approximate entropy of a finite binary string of arbitrary length" using "a
weighted average of the Shannon Entropies of the string and all but the last
binary derivative of the string." In other words, these metrics can be used to
help assess the disorder or randomness of binary or byte strings, particularly
those that are too short for other randomness tests.

This module includes both a Python C extension and a pure Python module
implementing the BiEn and TBiEn metrics from the paper, as well as a suite of
tests that verify their correctness. These implementations are available under
the submodules 'cbientropy' and 'pybientropy'.

Aliases of C versions of BiEn and TBiEn are included at the top level of this
module for convenience.
